Textbook
--------

The course textbook is [_How to Think Like a Computer Scientist_](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkCSpy/), through Chapter 12 (classes and objects). Links to individual chapters can be found [here](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkCSpy/html/).

The lectures stick with the order of the textbook for the most part, but not always.
